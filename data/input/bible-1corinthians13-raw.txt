Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity
